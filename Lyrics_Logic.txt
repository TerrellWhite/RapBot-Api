[Intro: Logic]
Woo, woo, yeah
Alright, here we go
Yeah yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Logic]
Money on my mind, so I'm too paid
Real all the time, never Kool-Aid, sippin' on D'usse, sike
Came a long way from G'burg
Puttin' in work like Ferg
New York to L.A., Hawaii and Japan
I'm the motherfuckin' man, 'least I'm feelin' like I am
Got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
But don't give a goddamn, I'm Sam, I am
What that even mean? I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Why nowadays everybody got a palm out?
PLP, yeah that be me and that be what I rhyme 'bout
I have arrived, all you rappers are in timeout
RattPack, where you at? (everywhere worldwide!)
I know you been waitin' for this world to collide
B. O. double B. Y., H. A. L. L., and Folarin
'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean
I am no historian, but here to make my predecessors proud
All you bitch niggas not allowed?
I put it on everything, I really want a cop out
But I did good for a dropout
Hop out the coupe, chicken heads go crazy
Gotta sound swag when the flow get lazy
What up? What good? Where you at? What you been on?
Anybody steppin' to me, promise they get shit on
Better hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to—
Hop up on the—hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to get on
Mixtape Bobby, that's the type of shit I spit on
Whew!

[Chorus: John Lindahl & Logic]
And it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no (I'll be damned)
I said it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Ohh, get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus: Logic, John Lindahl and Wale]
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this right now alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this right now alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
I said you gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive (Wale though)
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive (Yeah, RattPack, Blue Moon)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uh, smooth criminal, Mike Jack
Throw a subliminal, put your woman in black dress
They was in Timberlands, I was reppin' them Nike boots
'Member them nights that momma couldn't come right back
I'm on the path right now, put the plight on the mic
If I write mine down, I incite my crowd
I put Solbiato down (wholetime, wholetime!)
Used to go to Mark Twain, Mo County co-signed me
Got many flows that any ho would vouch for
I got many foes cause many hoes be out for
Had the Penny Foams, remember those was copper
Had so many homies talkin' 'bout, "How you got those?"
I'm Phil Knight in real life, I'm real Nike
It's flight club in my house, they not like me
More than likely they ain't got the heart to fight me
It's a lie, somebody seein' me needs some Visine, yeah
Let me let it breathe
Saint Laurent level, worry never worry me
I'm well aware they be wilding when they talkin' me
They bitches in the ballot whenever I be on the scene, oh
Hammers in the Uber, I be limousine though
Diamonds lookin' fluke but I got the same glow
And I got a juice back around the way though
My chain like a penguin's, Pellegrino (woo!)
We cold, we cold
Used to be in Lake Forrest with the Kobe fro
Eddie Bauer coat, Foams and a load of dope
Boat load of white hoes I sold it to, nigga
I was tryna survive, tryna survive
I was tryna survive, yeah, yeah
I was tryna provide, I was tryna survive
I put it down every time
Got some niggas alive, I got some niggas that not
Pour a little with brown liquor and look in the sky
Been the talk of the town, nigga, Virginia, Maryland
Did it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot
Hoes love me a lot, niggas hate me a lil
Anybody can hear me for real give me they props
Hookin' up with a couple models, nobody's gon' try to play us
The motto is get your paper and make you a lot
Pulling up with the Young Sinatra, I'm looking like Sammy Davis
The MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks
And the Stadium poppin', the Palladium poppin'
It's a fifty a place nigga, she thinkin' about it
I'll be damned

[Chorus: John Lindahl & Logic]
And it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no (I'll be damned)
I said it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Ohh, get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus: Logic & John Lindahl]
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
I said you gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive

[Verse 3: Logic]
Uh, woo, goddammit, I'm back at it
Never out of breath like an asthmatic, I done had it
Feel this shit, I'm an addict, back in Maryland livin' in the attic
Flowin' erratic, bringin' the static, bustin' like an automatic
I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest
My flow the fattest, hotter than a desert in Nevada
None other badder, fuck all the chitter and chatter, none of it matter
Pull the trigger and listen to the pitter and patter, let 'em shatter
Cause I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin', the killer
The Ripper, he callin', we'll go and he'll flow and you know
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it, stoppin' it, rockin' it
Talkin' it, walkin' it, flippin' it, rippin' it, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Goddammit, I'm back at it
Never outta breath like an asthmatic, I done had it
Feel this shit, I'm an addict, back in Maryland livin' in the static
Flowin' erratic, bringin' the static, bustin' like an automatic
I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest
My flow the fattest, hotter than a desert in Nevada
None other badder, fuck all the chitter and chatter, none of it matter
Pull the trigger and listen for the pitter patter, let 'em shatter
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin' the killer
The Ripper, he call and we'll go and he flow and you know
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it, stoppin' it, rockin' it
Talkin' it, walkin' it, flippin' it, rippin' it, no motherfuckin' script, no
I'm rippin' and livin', strivin' the killer
Ripper, he callin', we'll go and he flow
Listen, rippin' and livin' and strivin' to kill it, the-
Alright, we gon' do this one more time (listen listen)
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin', the killer
The Ripper, he call and we'll go and he flow and you know
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it, stoppin' it, rockin' it, talkin' it, walkin' it
Flippin' it, rippin' it, no mother to fuck up his script, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[Interlude: Logic]
This what we gon' do right now
I'ma test my syllable ability, you know what I'm sayin'?
I like to call this shit my syllability
I've been sippin' on this tequila right now
This one of the last songs we recorded for this motherfucker
So I'ma really go off on y'all right now
We gon' do this shit in one breath, alright?
This ain't no bullshit, this ain't-, nah, nah, nah, nah
This ain't no editin', we gon' do it like this
Are y'all ready? (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, are y'all ready? (Yeah!)

[Verse 4: Logic]
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin' to kill it
The Ripper, he call and we'll go and he flow and
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it
Stoppin' it, rockin' it, talkin' it, walkin' it
Flippin' it, rippin' it
Like the motherfuckin' script and I'm ready to go
When I buy it then break it, roll it (daaaaaamn!)
Then lick it and smoke it, choke on it later, yeah
Slicin' emcees like Darth Vader
Decapitate a hater the second I spit it

[Outro: Logic]
Say hell yeah (hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah




 [Verse]
Living life like this is so crazy
This world is amazing
One day you're on top and then she having your baby
Living life like this I get down... Uhh
When they come around
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop this shit, they gonna run it back
Stupid shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money, my bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back cause I'm gone




 [Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore




 I just want to take a moment right now and thank you all so much for giving me a platform to talk about something that mainstream media doesn't want to talk about. Mental health, anxiety, suicide, depression, and so much more that I talk about in this album. From racism, discrimination, sexism, domestic violence, sexual assault, and so much more. I don't give a damn if you're black, white, or any color in between. I don't care if you're Christian, you're Muslim, you're gay, you're straight. I'm here to fight for your equality. Because I believe that we are all born equal, but we are not treated equally and that is why we must fight. We must fight for the equality of every man, woman and child, regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. So, I say here and now, if you believe in this message and my lessons of peace, love, and positivity, and equality for all, then I demand that you rise to your feet and applaud not only for yourselves, but for the foundation we are laying for our children




 [Nakarat]
Son zamanlarda sessizdim
Zamanımı değerlendiriyorum
Aklımı kaçırmışım gibi hissediyorum
Hayatım benim değilmiş gibi hissediyorum
Kimi ilgilendirir?

Yaşamak istemiyorum
Yaşamak istemiyorum
Bugün sadece ölmek istiyorum, sadece ölmek istiyorum
Yaşamak istemiyorum
Yaşamak istemiyorum, izin ver de nedenini açıklayayım

[Verse 1]
Hakkında konuştuğum şeyler hakkında bir şey bildiklerini sanıyorlar
Birinin beni kurtarması için dua ediyordum, kimse kahraman değil
Hayatımın bir değeri yok, biliyorum, biliyorum
İçim acıyor ancak bunu gösteremiyorum
Bana ait diyebileceğim bir yerim olmadı
Hiç evim olmadı, kimse beni aramadı
"Neredeydin, neredesin, aklında ne var?"
Tüm hayatların değerli olduğunu söylerler ancak benimkini kimse umursamadı

[Nakarat]
Son zamanlarda sessizdim
Zamanımı değerlendiriyorum
Aklımı kaçırmışım gibi hissediyorum
Hayatım benim değilmiş gibi hissediyorum
Kimi ilgilendirir?

Yaşamanı istiyorum, yaşamanı istiyorum
Bugün ölmek zorunda değilsin, ölmek zorunda değilsin
Yaşamanı istiyorum, yaşamanı istiyorum
Ölmek zorunda değilsin, izin ver de nedenini açıklayayım

[Alessia Cara]
Kafan suda boğulurken aldığın ilk nefes
Sevdiğin ile göğüs göğüseyken havada dolanan o rahatlık
Yollar uzun olsa da devam ediyor ve en karanlık şeylerde bile ışığı görüyor
Kendi yansımana baktığın zaman kim olduğunu biliyorsun, bunun için tanrıya teşekkür edeceğini biliyorum

[Verse 2]
Neredeydin, neredesin, nereye gidiyorsun biliyorum
Hayata inanma sebebimin sen olduğunu biliyorum
Minik bir gece olmadan gündüzün anlamı ne ki?
Sadece minik bir ışık yakmaya çalışıyorum
Zor olabilir
Çok zor olabilir
Ancak şu an yaşamak zorundasın, feda edebileceğin her şeyin var şu an

Son zamanlarda sessizdim
Zamanımı değerlendiriyorum
Aklımı kaçırmışım gibi hissediyorum
Hayatım benim değilmiş gibi hissediyorum
Kimi ilgilendirir?

Sonunda hayatta olmak istiyorum
Sonunda hayatta olmak istiyorum
Bugün ölmek istemiyorum, ölmek istemiyorum
Sonunda hayatta olmak istiyorum
Sonunda hayatta olmak istiyorum
Ölmek istemiyorum
Ölmek istemiyorum

[Khalid]
Acılar aynı şekilde can yakmıyor, biliyorum
Gittiğim yol yalnız hissettiriyor
Ancak bacaklarım pes edene kadar devam edeceğim
Gözyaşlarımın karlar içinde eridiğini görüyorum
Ağlamak istemiyorum, daha fazla ağlamak istemiyorum
Canlı hissetmek istiyorum, artık ölmek bile istemiyorum
İstemiyorum, istemiyorum
Artık ölmek bile istemiyorum




 [Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

(Fight!)

[Verse 1: QuEst]
Chip on my shoulder, fuck is you sayin' ?
Swear to God our fathers were playing nigga relay the message
Breathless, every morning was forced to skip on breakfast
Mama told me don't let these peasants throw rocks at the king
Pawns tend to carry on with no conscience
Straight non-sense, pay homage or K's vomit, verbal
Fucker wanna know Biggie was making certain while niggas was getting iffy
Heart is bigger than derrières of Vicky and Nicki
But fuck up and diss me, this shit will 360
And must I mention my body count?
It's murderous, to be humble
Murder is to be humble?
Ever heard of me stumble?
I was born in the jungle where niggas belly's will rumble
Get checked for thinking or mumble
But y'all still stuck on rap
Fuck all that
I do this in my slumber, merely ventilation
Tryna stay afloat be on a boat shit
I swear that I'm lost inside of the spirit of Biggie back in his lumberjack
Or Nasir with the fatigue, I felt stifle, street's disciple
My raps are trifle, I shoot slugs for my...you get the picture
I was raised in Miami, niggas'll smack your coofie
Just for acting coochie, your goofy actions'll never move me
No sir, needy no, all my homies is ready to roll
Never the matter the chitter and chatter
I did it cause I can machete the flow
And comeback, here's a fun fact
I'm not a dumb act, run that
Little punk rat, fuck it, Pun's back
In the middle of Little Havana
Holding a hammer outside with pajamas
Better watch your grammar around me
These haters surround me, I swear it's unnecessary
Gambino, you childish niggas could never see the shit that I do
VMG, yes nigga VMG
Only competition that we see is TDE

[Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

Happy birthday to my nigga doe
(Fight!)

[Verse 2: C Dot Castro]
Imma be the guy that rap slow, sike nah
Dictating bitches and smoking Cubans, I'm Castro
My life is like the movie, and I'll be the director
And just to get a small role, got bitches acting extra
I wrote this verse in one minute cause Bobby said that he wants rhymes
Intelligent, but I'm getting brain from bitches that's dumb fine
Got punchlines like prom with the, world on my palm
I knew that we would blow up cause bitch, we be the bomb
Rattpack out to get the cheese, drop a verse, get fifty Gs
Hit the studio drunk as fuck but still drop a verse with ease
I don't give a fuck
Bitch you know the flow is second nature
With no pen and paper break it down disintegrate a hater, wassup

[Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

(Fight!)

[Verse 3: Jon Bellion]
Let's have a money conversation
Four hundred thousand from Eminem that's a payment
Kennedy Reagans presidential arrangement
Please don't let this Pop kid take it back to the basement
I'm still here screaming Beautiful Mind
Sick of the noodles of rhyming all my cubical grind
So I just grew and decided to put you in your spot
Ooodles and boodles of blue bags from Louis Vuitton
Getting money with lawyers we have a Jew of a time
With liquor in a Poland Spring like a Junior at prom
Yes I chose to pop charts I'm doing the crime
And that just means I'm fucking dope to you and your mom
Working in the summer, AC on freezing
Working in the winter like I got no heaters
Spring rolls at the damn four seasons
In the Red Octobers screaming thank you Yeezus

[Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Feeling, feeling this villainous vibe

(Finish him!)

[Verse 4: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe
Chilling with me and my Tribe
Gotta spit this to survive
How long have I been alive?
Twenty-four years and counting not including my momma womb
I'm here in the lab, and I'll be here until the tomb
Album coming soon watch the Rattpack consume
Aye, yo, yeah
I've been on that real shit
That fun shit
Spit artillery, like a gunship
V's up we run shit
Don't come around with that dumb shit it's scandalous
In the studio in Los Angeles
At No I.D. spot hit you with the heat rock goddamn
With Bobby on the board everybody on the floor
Hold up let me take a breath here come more
This a freestyle let me redirect my intellect
Drop this shit just for fun, it's all over the internet
Cause bitch I'm in effect
Wait hold up, y'all did get the Memo?
You Lumbergh rappers is Initech
Bitch I've been a fact
Hit you like Hiroshima then intercept
Check it yo
See now all the real fans know the album goin be crazy
Spit it off the top and get dirty like Pat Swayze
From the cover of XXL
Fuck around and then propel
Tour coming soon man I know the tickets finna sell
Really, coming for everybody's Achilles
Put my own money into this album, like half a milli
It's Logic, coming for their neck no disrespect
I did this shit in two minutes or less
Spent a year on the album, who knows what to expect (Sinatra)
Spent a year on the album, who knows what to expect
This is Logic

(Flawless Victory)
Happy birthday to me motherfucker
It's my birthday!

[Hook: Logic]
Feeling this villainous vibe

 [Intro]
Wake up, you bitch-ass
Cracker-ass motherfucker

[Verse 1: Logic]
See all I ever wanted was a window to sit close to
And you don't understand but in the end you ain't supposed to
I'm talking first class, 30,000 feet under my ass
Living life on the dash, constant pursuit of cash
Now I'm living a life that you and yours could only dream about
And just a couple years ago this shit I used to scheme about
Rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror
Until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer
See this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days
Fast forward to the present, rappers have no class like snow days
Good God, let me bring it back to hip-hops first renaissance
‘96 Kool-Aid and Sega Genesis

[Hook: Logic]
"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel"
Roll it and get high, light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky
I got em' saying
"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel"
Roll it and get high, light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky

[Interlude: Erykah Badu]
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye

[Verse 2: Logic]
So many people think that they know my whole situation
Conversations with people that handle public relations
Nothing but hundred dollar bills and standing ovations
Slowly pacing until I kill like that boy Jason
It ain't nothing, never folding or bluffin'
Get money, fuck bitches but respect women cause we love em'
Kiss em', touch em' and rub em'
Fuck em' but never grub em'
Hit it fast but then I slow it down like Robitussin
Shorty giving me brain until concussion
The club run out of vodka the second we rush in
Never under estimate the power in which I'm bustin'
My lyricism got yo girl blushin'
Ain't even touch her and yet she gushin' (ha)
Award shows, chilling with all my bros
Three-piece Ralph Lauren and some Jordans, I suppose

[Hook: Logic]
"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel"
Roll it and get high, light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky
I got em' saying
"Hey yo, hey yo, how you keep it so real
I love the way your lyrics make me feel"
Roll it and get high, light it up and fly
Feeling like I'm 30,000 feet up in the sky

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
Out my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin'
I don't wanna time travel no mo'
I wanna be here, my thinkin'
Say, on this porch I'm rockin'
Back and forth like Lightnin' Hopkins
So if anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him, "Beam me up!"




 [Intro]
If you're dealing war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)

[Verse]
Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

[Outro]
Come some more into my sight...




 Ayy, bitch, I've been goin' and goin' like the Energizer
Yeah, I'm supplyin' the wood like Elijah
In the cut, smokin' on indica
Might fuck around and compartmentalize ya
They say, they say life is a bitch
And if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her
No, I am not an adviser, but I do advise ya
To pay attention, never need to mention
I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads
Finna push it to the ledge
Yeah, I been smokin' my meds
Ain't got no love for the feds
Can't let fame go to yo head
Fuck with me, watch where you tread
I'm finna kill it instead
I'm finna, I'm finna, I'm finna
I will, I will do it like I never done it
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'
Like infinity, be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the start like this, from the heart like this
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous
Doin' righteous
I-I been, I-I-I been down this road before
Everybody think that they do but they don't
Swear to God that they would but they won't
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time
Me in my mind, feelin' divine, like yeah
Finna get it like yeah—yeah
Like yeah, like yeah (woo, woo, woo, woo)
I done made 20 million dollars (preach)
I don't flex to be acknowledged (preach)
At this point it's common knowledge (preach)
All you haters been abolished (preach)
You in the club throwin' dollars, but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (preach)
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (preach)
Just as long as they never say (preach)
"Daddy blew 20 million dollars (ayy)
He had to flex to be acknowledged (ayy)
He in the club throwin' dollars
And now cannot afford to send me to college (ayy)
Daddy just wanna be loved
Just like everybody wanna be accepted (ayy)
But somehow he had neglected
Me and my momma for all of this rap shit" (ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that shit (ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that
Who you know dropped an album
Back to back to back to back to back to back again?
I'm back again to snap again
And goddamnit, it ain't no other way around it
Yeah, it's happenin', 'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own
Leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Where I've been prone to destroy shit
You cannot avoid this, whack mothafuckas have annoyed this
Yes, you know I enjoy this
Preach, mothafuckin' preach
Yeah, I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets
Writin' words to the beats
Each one teach one, yeah, I'm tryna reach one
Who the beast one?
That be me, on the top to the East one
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now, time to murder this
Shout out everybody, no fuckin' around, ain't heard of this
Heard of us, we ain't goin' nowhere, it's a herd of us
Hold up, roll up
Levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want, we are not the same
Step in the spot, now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
That ain't a sign of the times
Then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4
And I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion
Check the numbers, I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore
But the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien
Star Lord, champion
Know the name, now they know the alias, that's for sure
Gave 'em 44, now here's 44 more




 [Intro]
I did it today, I made myself say
And I take back my tears, my sight, my love
No more does your magic work, on my heart
No more will your words ever tear me apart
I know now for certain, nothing's burning anymore
And I came strolling alone
Like your perfect girl in your perfect song
You'll forget who fixed you, in a little while
I know for certain, there's nothing burning anymore
I know now forever, nothing's burning anymore

[Skit: Tom Hansen in [500] Days of Summer]
"I love her smile, I love her hair, I love her teeth. I love this heart-shaped birthmark she has on her neck. I love the way she sometimes, licks her lips before she talks. I love the sound of her laugh."

[Verse 1]
I can feel it now, it's coming soon
It is my world, my sun and moon
Once upon a time, this world was love
But now I know this is everything that I've dreamed of
So take it slow, speed it up
Every time I see you I just want to beat it up
Maybe not, but that's a lie
C'mon baby girl, there ain't no need to cry
Just let me go or let me know
Why the hell you wanna stick around fo'
Arms length, that's all you do
Don't get too close, that is the rule
I remember when I met her back in high school
Science class, sitting on the stool
Now I'm feeling—feeling like a fool
Cause I cut that tie months ago, this girl is cruel
Or maybe not, just very lovely
No matter what she says I know she still loves me
So can I love?—I've already asked
Who would've known matters of the heart
Would be such a task?

[Skit: Tom Hansen in [500] Days of Summer]
"I hate summer, I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. And I hate the way she sounds when she laughs."

[Verse 2]
She used to be my girl
But now she just a girl I'm fucking
She used to mean the world to me
But now that world is nothing
I would've put a ring on that finger but I couldn't afford it
So I laced it with ribbon, she adored it
Sometimes I wonder if she thinks of me
But my mind tells me to focus on work so instinctively
How could the pussy be that good?
Cause my feelings involved
'Til my shorty evolved and her feelings dissolved
But that's what happens when you find them young
Treat them like royalty, and they will run
Searching the world for perfect love and realize you're the one
But they fucked up cause now that shit is done
This is a letter to the woman of my dreams
Love what she brings
So listen baby girl cause everything ain't what it seems
You either know me now or I'mma meet you after fame
But one thing's for sure, your life will never be the same
Cause you're gonna be my wife and my mistress
So understand now I can't be there for every Christmas
I love you more than anything, but I could never risk this
On stage living life, while you're forced to miss this




 [Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn, you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah we leave ‘em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capeesh, homie waddup!

[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down

[Verse 2]
I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
RattPack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it RattPack till the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind-state celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they momma's
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic

[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down

[Ad-Lib: Woman]
Mmmn, I'm thinking...
Okay




 [Intro]
Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high
Buck, buck, buck, buck, booyakasha!
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky
Buck, buck, buck, buck, booyakasha!

[Verse 1]
Now if you feeling how I'm feeling put your hands up high
If you feeling how I'm feeling put your lighters in the sky
I'll be damned if I ain't living the life I always wanted
Started from the bottom as a youngin gettin' blunted
Now I run it like a marathon, hoe, yeah it's on, hoe
Hits motherfucker, hits, Barry Bonds, hoe
In the studio for twenty-two days
I'm too paid, might fuck around and kickflip in my new J's
I got a show in Paris then Tokyo so I'm Lu-paid
Fucked a shorty in Paris, I'm getting crème brûlée’d

[Chorus 1]
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream

[Verse 2]
How you feeling, hoe?, I'm making a killing, hoe, really doe
Talking all that shit behind my back just like a silly (Hoe)
Had a dream: Dr. King, now that money ain't a thing
I've been through a lot of pain, looking like we overcame
Goddamn, life just ain't the same, all y'all know my name
Fuck the fame, Maryland where I came, broke up in the game
And it feel good, good, real good, good
Now we livin' in the hills pissing off the neighborhood
It's just me, Castro and 6ix, going crazy in this bitch
Plus my homie Jon, and the whole RattPack, you know we on
Livin' the life of a don while my homie, Slay, roll up the swisher
I get richer while they hate, watch the money gravitate
Finally eatin', grab a plate, hell yeah, that's sounding great
I've been high, I been low, but there's one thing that I know:
It's been a long time coming, now my whole team got it
And if you hatin', suck a dick and bitch about it

[Chorus 2]
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seem
When you following your motherfucking dreams, yeah

[Interlude: Richard Pryor (Sampled)]
You know it's funny doe, man, white people be frontin'
And you ever noticed like you'd be the only nigga some place
And you go where white people, they be like:
"You wanna move out of the way fellas? Excuse me, thank you very much - taking up all the fucking area, Jesus Christ!"
I love when white dudes get mad and cuss
'Cause you all are some funny motherfuckers when you cuss!
They be saying shit like "Alright, cut the shit! Fucking jerk off!"

[Chorus 2]
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seems
When you following your dream
Fuck a nine to five, I'm too alive for the real world
Never die in the real world, lie in the real world
Everything ain't what it seem
When you following your motherfucking dreams, yeah




 [Intro]
This right here, homie
This that first take shit, you know what I’m saying? For my real heads
All my real hip hop motherfuckers, they know they're Roots shit, you know what I mean?
So we gon' get it like this
Let that beat drop, Psychological

[Verse 1]
I spit fifties and shit hundreds
Do shit that's undid
Spontaneously combust in these bitches guts
I get 'em wet, no need to touch
Break their back like Dutches
Keep 'em close like the toast I clutch
Never the less
I'm never depressed
I keep feelings suppressed
One of the best but need to listen if I'mma progress
I'm ready to live, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to ride for rap
I said it on a record, now I can't take it back
Stop, I shut it down like a bloodclot
Smoke MCs, like a fuckin bumbaclot
Mic check, I come to catch wreck
Death before dishonor so I'm coming for your neck
I pop MCs like Hymens
Y'all glass posing in studs but I'm a diamond
Now recon, you need to listen
I'm never dissin'
Unless your shit is wack, I'll beat you into submission
Catch me fishin'
Cause I'm eating for a lifetime
Wisdom in my mind, I'm a star watch me shine
Fucking your bitch from behind, record it and hit rewind
I'm nasty, construct rhymes like rhinoplasty
A hip-hop statue
Rhymes coming at you, God bless you
When I kick wisdom it never stress you or test you
Unless you a dumb ass motherfucker

[Break]
(Psychological) Yeah, no want no more
Fuck it, ayo

[Verse 2]
Said this is mathematic tactics
Murder this rap shit
Intravenously inject my prophylactics
Inhale my words like a fresh batch of Vicks
Similar to black ice cause the flow so slick
What's up, rappers hear the rhyme they slit they wrists up
Do a whole 'lotta talking, no rapping like fisticuffs
Ah, yeah, (Turn my headphones up)
That's all you sayin' but I'm sprayin' and I can't get enough
Raw, rugged and rough
My alter ego, Mr. Tough
I'll call your bluff
Face to face never snuff
I murder you with predicate poetic balletic shit
No mercy cause if I grip the mic they might curse me
Da Vinci flow, when I grip the mic I’m in control
Before I manifested tendons I was rhyming as a embryo
Living in vertigo, half of these fuckers don't know

[Outro]
Yeah, all day
Drop tracks like that
All nuts in
Maryland stand up, that's it
I'm out, peace, one love
Fuck if you doubt me
(You are watching a master at work)
Todd? Todd? Would you care for a glass of grape juice?
I said, what?
Nigga, what the fuck is juice?
I want some grape drink, baby




 [Intro]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...

[Hook]
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'mma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'mma come through and show my wood pine

[Verse 1: Logic]
Boy I know my shit was on another level
When people would joke around and say I signed with the devil
Cause it's gotta be a sin to be this good
Hating on my music shit I wish you would (I wish you would)
Yeah I been offered four of five deals
Bust like banana clips boy that's four or five kills
Doing the most accumulating so much bread
I think it's time for toast and I ain't talking fine wine
I'm talking semi-automatic shit that blow your mind
Then when I blow like mine the whole world gon' see me shine
This is the life that I should live homie
I'm never going back, I'm addicted to the game
Y'all can tell by the tracks

[Hook]
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'mma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'mma come through and show my wood pine

[Bridge]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough


[Verse 2: Logic]
I'm addicted to the game, addicted to the pain
Of sacrificing matters of the heart just to obtain
Living a life that most won't attain
And I know it is essential
But when it comes to love, man, that shit is subsequential
For now I just be chillin' with ballers
Poppin’ collars, pushing Impalas, cutting records and counting dollars
I'm addicted, my lines is cocaine
And when they disperse blow minds like propane
And you know these haters that never made it this mad
Cause they never had what we had
Addicted to the game and I'm glad
On my Amy Whinehouse I'm saying fuck Rehab

[Hook]
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knockin, knockin doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'mma come through and show my wood pine

[Outro]
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...




 [Verse 1: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

[Refrain: Logic]
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I’m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life’s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it’s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

[Chorus: Logic]
(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah

[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

[Refrain: Logic]
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

[Verse 4: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me

Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida

Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my

[Bridge: Logic]
Sometimes I can’t get you out of my mind
Baby, no I just can’t find, I just can’t find
Such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind
Sometimes everyday right on time
But right now in my mind
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time

[Verse 5: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a...

Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her

[Skit]
Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me ?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not bout the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

[Outro: J. Cole]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, accept Him
