[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Aye who am I? (Yeah)

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Aye who am I?

[Hook]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Aye who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Outro]
I never felt better

 1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga




 1985, ben doğdum
33 yıl, vay be, hayatta olduğum için minnetarım
25'imizi geçmememiz gerekiyordu
Şakalar sana amcık, hala hayattayım
Yeni çıkan zencilerin hepsi genç
Herkes onların yaptığı müziğin aptalca olduğunu söylüyor
18 yaşımı hatırlıyorum da
Para, parti, amcık, ben de aynı şeylerin peşindeydim
Çocuklara büyümeleri için şans tanımalısın
Bugünlerde herkes bir şeyler biliyormuş gibi konuşuyor
Zenciler ayık gibi davranıyorlar ancak onlar parasızlar
Çabanızı takdir ediyorum ancak bu günlere sizler öncülük ediyorsunuz
Adamım, daha araba sürecek yaşta bile değiller
Onlara ne yapacaklarını söylemek mi? Ben kimim?
Onlardan birinin beni disslediğini duydum, şaşırdım
Yaklaş küçük adam, seninle konuşmama izin ver
Bakalım senin için büyük resmi çizebilecek miyim
Tebrikler, annenin evinden ayrılabildin
Umarım annene bir ev alabilecek kadar kazanırsın
Bakıyorum saatin parıltılı ve araban pahalı
Bir tavsiyem var, tur yapmayı asla bırakma
Çünkü bu günlerde biz rapçiler böyle kazanıyoruz
Garip lil rap isimlerinle dalga geçiyorum
Müziğini duyuyorum ve rap'in değiştiğini biliyorum
Bazıları bunun kötü bir şey olduğunu söyleyebilir
Çünkü artık her şey reklama dayalı ve pop
Trap drumlar havalı olan şeyler artık
Görüyorsun, yeni nesil için bir görevdeyim
Neyse boşver, bu sadece bir geçiş
Söylemem gerekli ki parçalarından etkilenmedim, hey
Ancak siyahi birinin para kazanması hoşuma gidiyor
Ayrıca bu işten zevk alıyorsun ve buna saygı duyuyorum
Ancak yarattığın etki üzerinde hiç düşündün mü?
Bu beyaz çocuklar senin hiç bir şeyi umursamamanı seviyorlar
Çünkü tenin siyah olduğunda senden bunu bekliyorlar
Senin dab atmanı bekliyorlar, senin hap atmanı bekliyorlar
Suratından topuklarına kadar dövme içinde olmanı bekliyorlar
Ve derinlerde bir yerlerde, siktir, gerçekçi olmam lazım
Onlar siyahi olmak istiyorlar ve parçalarının öyle hissettirdiğini düşünüyorlar
Yani sen bir şey yaptığında onların da yaptığını görebilirsin
Sonraki şehire geç, zamanı geldiğinde paranı topla
Paranı alıp, sürtükler içinde yüzüyorsun, seni suçlamıyorum
Ancak benim ve senin gibi gözükmeye çalışan insanları düşünmüyorsun
Doğru, yapman gereken daha önemli şeyler var
Kazandığın paralarla bir varoşu satın alabilirsin
Biliyorum bu gelir hiç bitmeyecekmiş gibi hissediyorsun
Ancak sana bunun doğru olmadığını söylemeliyim
Bir gün seni dinleyen çocuklar büyüyecek
Ve senin patlamana sebep olan şey için çok yaşlı olacaklar
Artık onlar gelmediği için şovların zayıf gözükecek
Ve bu ne yazık ki paranın azalması demek
Şimdi tekrar göz önüne gelmek için umuyor ve kıvranıyorsun
Ancak trendleri takip ettiğin için patladığını unutuyorsun
Şimdi sen eskidin ve pişmanlıklar içinden geçiyorsun
Çünkü o evi satın almadın, yerine Benz aldın
Onlarca mücevher ve ayakkabı aldın
Onlarca sahte arkadaş edindin, seni yargılamıyorum
Sadece rap yaptığın konu hakkında rap yapmaya  devam edersen neler olacağını söylüyorum
Dibe gitmek için iyi bir rota
Sana iyi şanslar diliyorum
İyiliğin için göründüğün kadar aptal olmadığını umuyorum
Ancak insanların söyledikleri gerçekse
Gerçekten benim adımla dalga geçiyorsan
O zaman gerçekten boku yediğini bilirim, güven bana
Sonsuza kadar çevrende olurum çünkü yeteneklerim yeri boylamak isteyen tüm zenciler için kusursuz
İşler boka sardığında dediklerimi hatırla
Beş yıl içinde Love&Hiphop'a çıkacaksın zenci




 [Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yes, straight out the Ville and I'm blessed
Never met death, well, at least not yet
Off to the place where they rest under flowers
Niggas get wetter, like sex in the shower
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the hoes? Or the money? Or is there more?
I know the world is going to come to an ending
Before it does can finish up my sinning?
I see the devil grinning, as if he was winning
This is the bottom of the ninth inning
I'm coming back like light skinned
What a sad sight, looking at my gas light
Like "Damn man, I just threw 10 in"
Look five dollars won't get you what it use too
And look, love don't mean what it use too
And everybody and their mommas on youtube
Is it just me, or is this unusual?
Don't wanna loose ya', just wanna reach ya'll
So let me slow down, to the beat ya'll
Put the remote down, move your feet dawg
One time for the niggas holding heat ya'll
Keep that tucked, 'fore somebody get hurt
See me, I rather cut catch her body give birth
If you were the last nigga walking on earth
Turn yourself and clap your hands like this was church

[Hook: J. Cole]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I say money make the girls go down
They say money make the world go 'round
So my broke niggas, ain't it a shame
If Bill Gates made it rain
Then world goin' drown
Can I get a dollar?
Shawty got a low Impala
Made that ass drop, hydrola', holla!
Know she got a man, and I don't understand
Why he don't grab that bitch by the collar
Follow, look uh
I need my women a little hood
Living in a world where bad means good
That explains why the bad hoes attract 'em
That explains why the bad rappers go platinum
Or gold these days, go DJ
If the world stops spinning like a old DJ
Keep playing, I need a little more time
Pre paying, just a few more dimes
We slaying, keep praying, hoping
2012? You gotta be joking!
Ain't enough time and a nigga trynna' sign
But +The Whole World+ done lost they minds
Look, bombs over Baghdad, bullets in the Ville
This is not a test, this is not a drill
This is all real so before we all kill
Let me get one more feel. Baby!

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Lil Cole]
Yeah, hey
Duck motherfuckers, run for your lives motherfucker
It's Lil Cole nigga. hahaha
The world is coming to an end nigga (It's coming to an end motherfucker, haha)
It's coming to an end trust me
I see it all revelation motherfuckers, all that shit
It's Lil Cole, you know I'm going in straight in to heaven nigga, holla at me

[Bridge x2]
Earthquakes and tsunamis and hurricanes
You meaner than Katrina baby I gotta know your name
Before this thing is over this might be the last song
For the man upstairs put the lights on and shut this party down

[Hook]
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like

[Intro]
Hey I got a dolla and a dream
But its all a nigga got so its about that green
And I'm all up in that spot
Hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains?
Knowing they kill 'em
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street..I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn’t trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow

[Hook]
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo

[Verse 3]
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Throwin' blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I’m so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don’t worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like

[Outro]
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey




 [Verse]
Yeah, grew up with killers, I ain't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega Man on Sega, man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah, a real black queen
If I had a genie, I'd wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house this shit was like a timeout
From reality, one night you asked me what I'm crying 'bout
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep when I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'
I don't know if he'd been drinkin', but I know this shit got loud
And I heard rumbling from struggling and rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound, my mama saying "Get off me!"
My tears is tumbling now, I wish that you never saw me
'Cause I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only twelve
I wish I wouldla bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf, if nothing else
Scared a nigga shitless, there goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast forward to our older years, two different paths
You used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold
Your demise, one day much to my surprise
My nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn
Not my nigga, the same one that told me
That things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit, ayo genie last wish, free my nigga




 [Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
For your eyes only




 




 [Intro]
Okay, I lied
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Motherfuckers tryna say I can't come to the hood—true lie
See, I would, but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'ma roll through that
Snatch yo' bitch, give yo' niggas dap
The hood gon' ballistic
"Cole was here and you missed it"
"That nigga walk like Obama man
Shook yo momma hand and then kissed it"
This pimp shit, this pimp shit
Cole hard, you limp dick
My flow hard, no wimp shit
Put in that work, no temp shit
Ya bitch wearin' that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga so wack when the bitch came back
He kissed her hoping that it get him sick, ha
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rapping shit
Ville made it to the map and shit
Niggas move 'caine like Kappa shit
Can't map this shit
From no bed springs in my mattresses
To fuckin' these bad little actresses
I'm bad as shit, ha

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

[Chorus]
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit, bitch

[Post-Chorus]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce

[Verse 2]
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow tight, put a nigga in a headlock
Fuck hoes out of wedlock, make her bed rock
Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit
So if you send shots then you bet not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Met Lock shit (testify)
I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the newer shit, rockin' jewel shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull shit
Stop the bullshit watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable?
Keep niggas on they toes, no Dr. Scholls
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said

[Chorus]
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rap and shit
Say what?
Ain't that some shit, bitch

[Post-Chorus]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce

[Outro]
My nigga Syience killed this motherfucking beat




 [Verse]
Yeah
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average
Lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?
I am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
Plus, I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes—but that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin'—treat the beat like Playstation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up
A book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathias
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction
Man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD—album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen since the late MC whose name was The Notorious—
Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winning back to back
Next up to bat is my nigga, Bas
After that, Jiddy-J.I.D
That's that New York City kid plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville, but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell

[Instrumental Break]

[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Hook]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Hook]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I




 [Verse 1: J. Cole]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

[Verse 2: J. Cole]

Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the girls, or the money or is there more?
I know the world ’bout to come to an endin’
So, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin’
I see the devil grinning, as if he winning
This just the bottom of the 9th inning
I’m coming back like light-skin and
What a sad sight, lookin’ at my gas light
Damn, man, I just threw ten in
Look, 5 dollars won’t get you what it used to
And, look, love don’t mean what it used to
And everybody and they momma on YouTube
Is it just me or is this unusual?
Don’t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y’all
So let me slow down to the beat y’all
Put the remote down, move ya feet y’all
One time for the boys holdin’ heat y’all
Keep that tucked ‘fore somebody get hurt
See me, I’d rather cut let ya body give birth
Now, if you was the last man walking on Earth
Turn this up, clap ya hands like this was church
Hey…and clap for him…
