Part I: XXX
[Intro: Bēkon]
America, God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst—

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
Been a messed up day for me
Know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
I can bring him closer
Spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody killed my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a homie's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch the homie leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Man, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you play with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, man, I promise
You chip the homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—

The screen reads: "This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar"

[Chorus: Bono & Kendrick Lamar]
It's not a place
(Uh-huh)
This country is to me a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
It's not a place
(Uh-huh)
This country is to me a thought that offers grace
For every welcome that is sought
Part II: DNA
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Run your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
On your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
Run your life, I live a--
Run your life (ahh)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

Tell me somethin'
Uh, you can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA is an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floor
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the camera
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Won't you tell'em I got millions on the way

[Spoken: Dave Chappelle]
Hi, I'm Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption, please continue...


Part III: Freestyle

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah
Say got work for Kung Fu Kenny
Know you got work, got work for plenty
Him got, her got, more got, Benji
Damn
Top off, getting topped off in the city
Big Top Dawg and I dance on 'em like Diddy
Pop off and I pop back like Fifty
Yeah
Part IV: New Freezer + Kings Dead
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta dance
I Milly Rock when I get that advance
How can I shop with like 64 M's?
Talkin' to Top about business again
He want some lot with new Bentleys again
I want some top from like two sets of twins
Twenty twin twins, yeah, yeah

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria, but I don't see it
I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic, tapped in when I'm maxed in
Comp-Town with the MAC 10s and the pumps in the background
Absent, never OG, standout
Lackin' everything else but doubt
Magnum, holding Magnums with a Magnum
Homie, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"

[Spoken: Dave Chappelle]
Is this on cable? CBS? It looks like it's singing and dancing, but this brother's taking enormous chances. Rumble, young man, rumble!
Part V: King's Dead
[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Never had friends, never had ends
Never had hope, they was like "nope"
I was like "boo yaow"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day
Know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Burn integrity, burn your pedigree, burn your feelings
Burn your culture, burn your moral, burn your family
Burn your job, burn your land, burn your children, burn your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger




 [Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ooh, ya'll done stumbled on a fortune
The rebirth of hip hop since they got abortions
And I rock like Mt. Rushmore, grab your thesaurus
So you can find a synonym of a nigga that been gem
Diamond in the rough
Sheriffs wanna see me cuffed like the links of a button up
Book em down! Fuck is up?
Mind of a Vietnam Vet when a nigga rhyme
A nigga shine, like I'm seeing signs in a different light
I'm on my grind, see it right? Real starving artist
Finna blow like a Mario Game cartridge, standing on my own two
Me and Dave like Big and Puff before shiny suits
Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue
A tiger on Central
Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me
More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we..

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ooh, and I'm back up on my bullshit, shooting to the top with a hollow
Tip full clip
Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I don't really
Spit, mad dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse?
Sipping Mickey's, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out
That's not a diss, that's really a dope line, and in order to see my vision you
Probably would go blind
I'm chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that make you tell your mom
I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug and wear
My cousins hand-me-downs
Now I'm grown up, unemployed, sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get
The job done, 2DopeBoyz I said what up, tell your listeners to have some frost
Bitten gloves cause

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]




 [Hook: Jay Rock]
We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You should already know what I came for
Once the neon light hit the Top Dawg logo
See my, chain hang out
See my, wrists hang out
See my, homies hang out
They, gang bang out
West coast my state, left coast my state, you state myspace, internet gangster
You know my name baby girl no stranger
Blue Bell jeans on low cut taper
No I can't save ya
Name that captain
[?] when I'm in the Aston, Martin
So awkward when I park it
Rev up your engines, sound like it farting
I'm in the club sitting with some foreign
She don't speak English words sound retarded
We go hard in that project apartment
Five minutes in Watts, get it started

[Hook: Jay Rock]
We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Sit back relax I'mma give you a walk through, through the city of Watts, through the city of God
Where them bitches shaking that ass, deuce deuce in they bras
Where them niggas rockin' the flash, drinkin' liquor that’s hard
Where they keep the Glock in their pants, chopper's right in the car
And if you step up on the daily's you might leave with a scar
If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a ménage
And that's night life, in Watts California
Parties ain't over till like six in the morning
This Hennessey's straight, gotta nigga zoning out
Take another swig then I'm rolling out
If you ain't banging better hold your mouth
Don't claim nothing that you know you're not
So just chill, grab your bitch because life's too short
Just stick to the script

[Hook: Jay Rock]
We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up




 [Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Said I'm a fuckin' monster
A massive attack I haunt ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometors
Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia
Will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet (BLAHH!)
And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap
Rock with us Metallica, competition no talented
I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq
Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep
My science applyin' pressure her stretcher is needed pay the proceeds
Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet
I spit 'til I feel my breath
Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest
She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Mean my dick is the dick of death
Means I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate
Whether your beat makin' or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans
Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan (laughs)
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout, about face with army outfits
The generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory
Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it
Show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics
Who your boss, he more like my assistant
Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Q...Q

[Verse 3: ScHoolBoy Q]
Double up, shit, what the fuck?
Get me some my promo poppin'
Setbacks droppin'
Soon they watchin'
I just lock and load explode
Target flowed I'm somewhere blowed
Marriotts and Swisher Sweets
LA nigga prolly east
Cheerin' for the ragin' beats
X O henny scrape the keif
Bangin C I'm bangin' B
Put them niggas next to me
Stop and focus get the lead
I'm here now let the hardest speak
Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period
Run on sentence still I'm ventin'
Air conditionin' coolest breeze
Ill diseases
Grip my penis, shoot my semen
Still I'm comin', miles a runnin'
I was learnin' getting knowledge
Head is throbbin', she's a goblin
We be mobbin' over bitches
Stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness pussy frenchin
Yes, a mission
Poppin' off like a mission
Proposition, gettin' money
Drop a nigga, rush a nigga
Stomp a nigga, crush a nigga
Dust a nigga, copperhead gon' thrust a nigga
Heatin' up the winnnin nigga
Somethin' to remember nigga
Hella sick, I got a spit
Curse with a verse like God told me to kill the shit
Load the clip Heckler & Koch
The hoover king
Bada bing by the ding a ling
Natural hoover
Fing ring with a vision clearin' it with Visine
Asian from Beijing
Money maker, cum she cream
Feed the weak that's Wing Stop
At the start with rain drops
Autobot
Space shuttle shittin on your car lots
Boy style
Could at least got a saturn, huh?
HiiiPoWer see our patent, huh?
Workin' on tracks like we never been free
22 squezze niggas shootin' off C’s
Please thought a nigga shot 16’s
Rhyme 16’s
Bada bing, bing, bing, bing.... bing

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
If you want to be from HiiiPoWeR
Please come to friend zone
But don't wowwy
You will not suck on my dick tonight




 See I'm an A1 type of guy
I crush A1 hoes (true)
Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
And still pour A1 sauce on my shit
I come from the bottom

Crushing all these hoes, rocking all this ice
Selling all these O's, nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls, about to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood and I put that on my life
I'm like yeah nigga, I'm there nigga, I ball hard all year, nigga
My diamonds all clear, smack my chain you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk, and all my dogs go hard, fuck that
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all types of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump right back like 36, lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal, then I still be serving bricks
So I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role cost 60 racks, my rose gold cost 40

[Chorus]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Cuz I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips, and I rock A1 clothes

Pray to God I washed my hand, but I be damned
2012 100 racks to Uncle Sam
A 24 year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit, park my car bowlegged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jerome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your ho be cropping the image
I let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish it
Then come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up
Then more ca-ca-ca-ca, til I know I gotcha
Ballin like I'm baldin', then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga that's flawless VVS, CC text me what you wearing
Puttin my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips thats power steering
About to hydroplane when I board that plane and land inside the building

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
S'Fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your little sister
Just get a sip of this elixir, before they crop us out of the picture
I've never seen a crop circle but I've seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear one day I'ma stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career, while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams? (Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)
One two, three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary

[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin, you vote for the better man
Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unify people they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ay yo Dot, won't you let these cats know
We knew we'd be here, like back in 04'
Started HiiiPower because our generation
Needed a generator and a system, meant to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend with his girlfriend's girlfriend
Let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight)
But our future is not, that Martial law shit dropped, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public
Work a little nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes
And to thank God you're alive (HiiiPower)
And on another note, we focused like the Hubble Telescope, Soul

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh]
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn one to twenty one listen to Kendrick
For instance
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story, hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now my child, come on
See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on the earth searching for answers
'til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it 'cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human mothafuckin' being, over dope ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck 'em up Terrace (Soul!)

[Outro]
I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor and respect
This is you, this is me
And we are HiiiPower




 [Intro]
Uh-uh, fuck that (fuck that)

[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1]
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
And you feel like no one can relate
‘Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
Playstation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D

[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Post-Chorus]
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D. did it)

[Verse 2]
And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon?" "Oh, I rap, baby."
"How old are you?", She say 22, I say 23
"Okay, then we are crack babies."
"Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later
Just tell your neighbors that the police relaxed."
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, "Read between the lines."
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown
Her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
Then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood."
"You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D. crazy."

[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Post-Chorus]
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D. did it)

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Chorus]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

[Verse 1]
She got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still I feel ya
Energy sending me towards the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
And I'm wowed, no one compares
A one-on-one, you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young

[Pre-Chorus]
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...

[Chorus]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

[Verse 2]
So now we on, so now we going
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...

[Chorus]
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)

[Outro]
You something different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you




 Gimme that '94 Puff shit, Ali
I'm so appalled, Louis Vuitton draws
The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, Little Duval
I have a lot of flaws, I'm human before all
I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me
Mos Def, word to every autopsy
Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People don't understand why I went southpaw
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Cause my shit different
I know
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto, on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em
Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from
Where my heart turned numb
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son
It's the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
'quivalent crimes for jail sentencin'
No one preventin' this war
You sure, you sure
Sure as the edges on every ocean, now let's explore
The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin' for 'bout a month
Don't worry its comin' soon, like a fast nut
I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin', I guess they got bad luck
Your bad, you don't write neither? There goes another fad
Shit I write ether
I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin' your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This is very extra necessary
This extra scary, this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I can't do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got a fat ass but lower case titties
Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black
Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact
Reg call 'em Jabberjaw, she gon' hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
Man these hoes pitiful
And to you bloggers that say I'm weak
You know how long I took to chop this fuckin' beat?
Y'all don't 'preciate shit
All y'all do is hate shit
And if I don't say shit y'all still say I ain't shit
And that's ridiculous
I mean that shit is
Fucking ridiculous

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "Yah!"
Bad trips like, "Yah!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers

All I care about is airin' out ya upper body
When I catch it, when I catch ya walkin' out your parent's house (Alright)

Big K's and my big dogs, never, ever, went stray homeboy alright! (Alright)

When I catch ya, when I catch ya, walking out your parents house
(Alright)
Fourteen years old sound so raw making plays home boy
Big K's and my big dogs
Never, ever, went straight home, boy
(Alright)




 I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around
So I kept running
Until I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was
(In the room, and I run it)

But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination

Ay on my momma nigga (R.I.P. Pat Dawg)
I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma doe like
On the dead homies
Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga
Turn this shit up! Sounwave, turn this shit up nigga

Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free
To Pimp a Butterfly another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy

[Intro]
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "God!"
Bad trips like, "Yea!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us
Then we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]

[Intro]
(Top Dawg, Money GANG)
Owwww, Dave, I see you, now see me

Look, I Say I'm a millionaire
I'm a Top Dawg millia- no let me just come in unorthodox
I order plenty ammunition for the enemies that I got
I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
Stepping on em' like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
So where do I go now
Swear there is none after
I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
I would probably burn your whole colony
Chew you up then spit you out
Your nothing but a Polla Seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
You never seen a killer til you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like Assadomy
Fuck them bitches properly
I do it
I do it, done it run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomber whoever
Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave
Sasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is I sasquatch can rap
Motherfucker I'm iller
Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track
The people like "What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?"
There's some boy named K Dot and he's a maniac!
I think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie in fact
He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat
He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back
I think that boy from Iraq , I think y'all boys better know that
He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where ya'll came from
Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
On your side motherfucker, side motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
When I go pop pop
Open up close shop like a retail spot
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Bitch thats no lie, let the truth be told
K Dizzle the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up
Rap-Ist I'm iller
Dig it, like it, love it a lot




 [Excerpt from "Mortal Man"]

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga
